Description: High level Apple event bridge for Python
DescDetail: <<
AppScript is a user-friendly Apple event bridge that allows you to control
scriptable Mac OS X applications using Python scripts.

Appscript provides:
  o  an Apple event based mechanism for sending commands to applications and
     receiving their results
     
  o  a simple embedded query language for constructing references to an
     application's object model
     
  o  the automatic translation of these references into human-readable form
     using application-defined terminology
     
  o  a powerful integrated help system for exploring applications' interfaces
     using their terminology
     
  o  a clean, object-oriented-like syntax
